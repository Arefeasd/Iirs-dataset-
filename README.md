# Iris Species Classification

This project is a machine learning analysis using the famous **Iris dataset**. It aims to classify different species of Iris flowers based on their features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).

---

##  Project Overview
The main analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook, covering:
* Data exploration and visualization.
* Data preprocessing and cleaning.
* Model training and evaluation.

##  Project Structure
* `Iris.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
* `.gitignore`: A file to tell Git which files/folders to ignore (like checkpoints).
* `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

##  Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
* **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
* **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning)
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualization)
* **Jupyter Notebook** (to run the `.ipynb` file)

##  How to Use
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
   
2. Navigate to the folder:
```bash
cd your-repo-name

3. Open the Notebook: Launch Jupyter and open Iris.ipynb to see the full analysis.
